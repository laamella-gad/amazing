An old pet project of mine where I investigated the magic that is maze generation.
I implemented several algorithms in a hopefully clear way,
before concluding that most of these algorithms are variations of a few base algorithms.
The plan was to make a visualisation of the algorithms,
but that never got off the ground.
You can look at the pretty printer for how that could be done.

All algorithms I could find at the time have their own class,
and some Javadoc has been added to explain what the algorithm is (or should be) and where the information was found.
