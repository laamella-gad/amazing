/**
 * The interesting thing about this algorithm is it generates all possible Mazes
 * of a given size with equal probability. It also requires no extra storage or
 * stack.
 * <p>
 * Pick a point, and move to a neighboring cell at random. If an uncarved cell
 * is entered, carve into it from the previous cell. Keep moving to neighboring
 * cells until all cells have been carved into.
 *
 * <p>
 * Start at any node.
 * <ol>
 * <li>If all nodes have been visited, halt.
 * <li>Choose a neighbor of the current node uniformly at random.
 * <li>If the node has never been visited before, add the edge to that node to
 * the spanning tree.
 * <li>Make the neighbor the current node and go back to step 1.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This algorithm yields Mazes with a low "river" factor, only slightly higher
 * than Kruskal's algorithm. (This means for a given size there are more Mazes
 * with a low "river" factor than high "river", since an average equal
 * probability Maze has low "river".) The bad thing about this algorithm is that
 * it's very slow, since it doesn't do any intelligent hunting for the last
 * cells, where in fact it's not even guaranteed to terminate. However since the
 * algorithm is simple it can move over many cells quickly, so finishes faster
 * than one might think. On average it takes about seven times longer to run
 * than the above algorithms, although in bad cases it can take much longer if
 * the random number generator keeps making it avoid the last few cells. This
 * can be done as a wall adder if the boundary wall is treated as a single
 * vertex, i.e. if a move goes to the boundary wall, teleport to a random point
 * along the boundary before moving again. As a wall adder this runs nearly
 * twice as fast, because the boundary wall teleportation allows quicker access
 * to distant parts of the Maze.
